Made With ;) by Hanna Skairipa & Bradley Wu

Welcome to the official SoulSync GitHub repository! Here, you can find the server, admin panel, iOS/Android client, and the public website for SoulSync. 

## About SoulSync
SoulSync is a unique app designed to help you make friends and build meaningful connections. Recognizing the importance of safety, we have included a dating section to mitigate potential abuse. SoulSync offers a variety of features including **realtime messaging**, **date/hangout planner**, **calendar integration**, and much more!

To get started, download the production version from the Apple App Store, contact us for beta access, or follow along for the latest updates and versions.
